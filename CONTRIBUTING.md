# Getting started

It's recommend that you use a IDE such as vscode (with arduino and c++ extensions installed).
Make sure you don't have a formatter that changes the style of all the code, this just pollutes the git history. As that said, please follow the same way of formatting (Ex. How curly braces are placed).
